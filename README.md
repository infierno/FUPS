== About the HTML & PHP Book Downloader ==

This script is very simple.

You have an URL, and want to catch all the .php and .html pages (or another exotic extension)?

Well, just edit the URL shown as an example in the script, and specify the number of pages the book/tuto/site has.
chmod +x HTML_PHP_Book_Downloader.sh to make it executable
./HTML_PHP_Book_Downloader.sh to launch it.

And the second part of the script will rename every 1.{php,html} in 01.{php.html}.

And then you have your book. YOU SHOULD CREATE A SPECIFIC DIRECTORY FOR THE PAGES ! :D
